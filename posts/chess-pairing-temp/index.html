How I came to this project
Each year we have a small round-robin tournament in our chess club during Christmas time. Up to 15 players. And every year we struggle with the pairing. It looks easy, but definitely is not.
We used to do it by hand in paper table and every time there are mistakes.
I did some research and found many web projects tackling this problem.
But there is always some BUT.
Most of them have some limitations, you always need to register somewhere and most of them try to convert you to some pricing plan.">

Most of them have some limitations, you always need to register somewhere and most of them try to convert you to some pricing plan.</p>
<p>I understand it, but I still want something:</p>

<p>And I always wanted to build some web page other then boring tutorial&rsquo;s ToDo list. This sounds like perfect challenge for me.</p>
