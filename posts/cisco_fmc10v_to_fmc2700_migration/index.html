Will be first deployment from new FMC2700 to FTDs safe? without any unwanted changes? Documentation didn’t address my concerns. So that’s also the reason I share my memories.\nNotes to LAB environment We had to create LAB network environment as in production - if we want to connect to restored FMCv10 We isolated LAB environment from outside world - we did not want to allow restored FMC to contact Cisco Smart portal We added test FTDv to restored FMCv10 to see, if it will survive two migration steps - our canary in coal mine ;) We followed official cisco guide all devices (FMCv10, FMC2600, FMC2700) were on the same 7.4.2 version and patch Observations and experience As there was not pending deployments while backup production FMCv10 (required), there was no need to deploy right after migration by script (nothing to deploy) Test FTDv (our canary) was ‘always-on’ so no trouble with any reconnecting of FTD. The same with production FTDs after we turned on FTD2700 onsite. Sftunnels survived both migrations. There was not possible to test deployment to test FTDv after migration (with some small change), because missing licenses in LAB FMC. We shuted down source FMC after copying backup file to destination FMC and then start the script (documentation says to disconnect destination FMC during running script, but only reason is to avoid IP address conflict) backup file on destination FMC must be in exactly in folder /var/sf/backup/, otherwise script will fail. If you do not need to migrate events do not do it (documentation requires it, but it takes much more time. Migration works well even without events migration) Unregistration of old FMCv10 and registration of new FMC2700 was straightforward. The only small issue was that after registration, we had to manually assigned licenses to devices. They somehow lose Thread licenses. We compared LINA configuration before and after deployment from new FMC2700 to be sure, that there were no changes. they were identical. Script output.

  <div class="post-content"><p>It is more then strange, but if you buy a new Cisco FMC1700/2700/4700 management server appliance today and want to migrate configuration from virtual FMCv2/10/25 to it, you&rsquo;ll quickly find that there is no supported migration path.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/FMC_migration_1.png"></p>
<p>This was also confirmed me by a TAC engineer.<br>
Cisco really does not support direct migration from FMCv (versions 2/10/25) to FMC 1700/2700/4700 hardware appliances.<br>
Only paths from FMCv to older appliances FMC1600/2600/4600 and from FMC 1600/2600/4600 to newer FMC 1700/2700/4700 are supported.</p>
<p>We had 3 options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Migrate manually</li>
<li>Crack migration script to allow direct path</li>
<li>Use middle-step with FMC 2600 appliance</li>
</ol>
<p>As an option 1 was extremely laborious in our case,<br>
and option 2 was explicitly not recommended by TAC (with risk of side effects),<br>
we went with option 3.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to share some notes from such migration.</p>
<h2 id="our-path">Our path<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#our-path">#</a></h2>
<p>We were lucky to borrow an older FMC2600 server, so our path was:</p>
<p><strong>FMCv10 &mdash;&gt; FMC2600 &mdash;&gt; FMC2700</strong></p>
<p>Our plan was to completely prepare new FMC2700 <strong>offsite</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replicate production FMCv10 (standard restore from backup) in LAB environment (without connectivity to production FTD devices)</li>
<li>Migrate FMCv10 to FMC2600 by script</li>
<li>Migrate FMC2600 to FMC2700 by script</li>
</ul>
<p>And then in the day of migration continue <strong>onsite</strong> with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deregister FMCv10 from Cisco Smart account</li>
<li>Turn-off FMCv10</li>
<li>Turn-on FMC2700</li>
<li>Register FMC2700 to Cisco Smart account</li>
<li>Test deployment</li>
</ul>
<p>I had following concerns before action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will be necessary to deploy to FTDs in the middle-step? (from FMC2600)</li>
<li>Will stay FTDs devices connected after migration? Or will we somehow supposed to recover connectivity?</li>
<li>Will be first deployment from new FMC2700 to FTDs safe? without any unwanted changes?</li>
</ul>
<p>Documentation didn&rsquo;t address my concerns. So that&rsquo;s also the reason I share my memories.</p>
